My first application build. This is a web browser. It is not fully functional but it can open some websites. This is not like Internet explorer. Since, it is not optimized for the web, it is slow and may not work with some websites.

Steps to install:
1. Click the "Download" button to download the .zip file.
2. Open the folder called "WebBrowser" inside the .zip folder. It is optional to extract the files from the .zip folder.
3. Run "setup.exe" inside the folder. DO NOT RUN IT OUTSIDE THE .ZIP OR THE EXTRACTED FOLDER. Otherwise, it will not work.
4. Wait for the process to complete.
5. The Web Browser will launch.
